                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I've had an interest for computers since an early age and eventually found an interest in coding. I am a avid learner who is always looking to learn a new skill that would be useful for future employment. I strongly believe that coding is going to be an essential skill over the next 5 years which is why i'm putting high priorities into learning. </p>
                    <p>One of the reasons why i'm very excited about going into coding is to be able to collaborate with others on a project! Working on a team is a huge bonus for me because ideas are shared all around and the tasks are divided up among the group. I've always been fond of group projects while I was in highschool and college and I loved doing presentations.</p>
                    <p>Some of my interests include trading cryptocurrency part-time. I love the strong analytical thinking that is required to analyze a chart and make a decision. It was a good skill to pickup and I am always looking to refine and improve upon it.</p>
                    <p>I am also a tech enthusiast who loves keeping up with the next innovation and generation of products. I am always keeping up with the news such as the next processor or graphics card being released, or the next smartphone that's going to hit the markets.</p>
